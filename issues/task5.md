# #5: Promote your repo

Now that your team has finished most of the tasks, you have to promote it! Your tasks:

1. Look at your team's page here: `https://csci3250-2019.github.io/(repo name)`
2. Go to the public repo of **`csci3250-2019.github.io`** in the CSCI3250 organization
3. Edit the file to add a link of your team, and request for review from @chuckjee

And there you're done!
