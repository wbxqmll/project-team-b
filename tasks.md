# CSCI3250+3251 Project Milestone #3

Welcome! You are now assigned into a team with a number of your classmates, randomly. You are not sure who are in this group, and when they would start working. Now please read this document ***very carefully***.

## Tools to use
You may feel free to use any software (git commands, GitHub web, Atom, etc.) to interact with the system.

## Protected branch
Since the master branch is protected, you must create a pull request for every file edit, and have it reviewed by another team member so that it can be merged into the master branch.

## Your tasks to finish
0. Feel free to discuss in the team discussion board, owned by your team
1. In the folder **`_stu`**, create a file named `1155xxxxxx.md` (with your own SID), having the contents only as your full name, with your GitHub username
2. Under the **Projects** tab of your team, (when Issue #3 is done) in the project board, create a new card under **To do** and introduce yourself
3. There are 5 items to be finished in the **`issues`** folder, please do them in the order #1 -> #2 -> #3 -> #4 -> #5 (team work)
4. If you want to work on that issue, go to the **Issues** tab and create an issue with the name and contents in `issues/taskX.md`, then *assign yourself to this issue*
5. After you are done, pick any reviewer that's available (but not @chuckjee or @wbwuta), or you may need to wait when more people join your team
6. Be an effective and efficient reviewer
7. Put down proper comments in every request and review
8. When Issue #2 is done, please check the **`readme.md`** file and add your own line in **Contributors**
9. When you consider all your individual work is done, please go to the **Projects** board and move your intro to **Done**

## Reviewing
- There may be a lot of review requests of issues and pull requests (when people are adding files). Please carefully check the relevant tasks if they are done well, and choose to **Comment** or **Approve**.
- After checking that an issue is done correctly, you can close it (with comments)
- After reviewing that a pull request is okay to merge, merge it and close the request (with comments)

## Workload constraints
- Part of your work is graded individually, but mainly collectively as a team
- Your contribution to the 5 issues, reviews, and discussions will be considered in grading
- Every student should be assigned to **no more than ONE** issue
- Every student should make **no more than TWO** reviews
- Since some issues may not be done yet when you join, you may have to "watch" the repo so that you come back later to finish all your individual tasks

## Submission deadline
Everything will be finalised by **April 24 23:59**
